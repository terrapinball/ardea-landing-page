# Brand Identity: Ardea

**Tagline:** "From group classes to private retreats—all in one place."

## Target Market
- **Primary:** Sole proprietors and small businesses needing booking + customer management
- **Initial Focus:** Yoga studios
- **Use Cases:** Classes, appointments, events, retreats

## Positioning
The invisible infrastructure that secures the relationship between a service provider and their client. **Trust is currency** in the wellness world—Ardea treats privacy as a professional standard, not a tech spec.

## Core Pain Points We Solve

1. **The "Hybrid" Headache:** Managing a 20-person Vinyasa class at 9 AM and a 1-on-1 Reiki session at 10:30 AM without double-booking rooms or instructors.
2. **The Retreat Logistics Gap:** Most booking software isn't built for events requiring deposits, room selections, or intake forms.
3. **The Privacy Paradox:** Wellness professionals deal with sensitive client data (injuries, mental health notes, trauma-informed care) but rely on unsecure SMS or WhatsApp.
4. **Admin Burnout:** Scheduling privates via messy text threads leads to missed appointments and lost revenue.

## Killer Feature
**E2EE Secure Messaging** for direct messages and group chats (classes/events). Framed as professionalism, not just encryption:
- "Give your clients the peace of mind they deserve."
- "Move sensitive conversations out of Instagram DMs into a secure, professional environment."
- "Your client data is exactly that—yours. Even we can't see your private messages."

## Visual Language
- **Core Aesthetic:** Neutral & Minimalist (Professional utility)
- **Accents:** Sage Green (Growth/Peace) and Terracotta (Earth/Craft)
- **Typography:** Modern Sans-Serif (Inter or Geist) for a "Tech-Forward" feel
- **Personalization:** The UI acts as a "Gallery" that highlights the Studio's brand, not Ardea's
- **Trust Signals:** Visual icons for HIPAA and GDPR compliance
