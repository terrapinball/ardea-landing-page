# Technical & Design Constraints

1. **Neutrality:** No loud brand colors in the dashboard. Use Grays/Slate to allow studio photos to pop.
2. **Key Management:** Ardea (the server) must never have access to the user's private keys.
3. **Offline Access:** Booking calendar should be cached for quick viewing in low-signal areas (studios).
4. **Mobile UX:** The 'Direct Message' experience must feel as native as iMessage/WhatsApp.
